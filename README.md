# EP425_Project
* Our senior project for Astronomy and Astrophysics, observing a variable white dwarf. 

### Our target GD 358 is a variable white dwarf star of the DBV type. Like other pulsating white dwarfs, its variability arises from non-radial gravity wave pulsations within the star itself. It has an apparent magnitude of V = 13.65 and B = 13.53, thus we can use a B-filter to image the star to get the 0.12 mag difference. GD 358's pulsation amplitude can range up to 0.30 mag with a pulsation period of 600-700 s.
